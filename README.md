# Investigators: Pivots & Complications

This here repo is the Foundry module version of the [supplement of the same name on Pathfinder Infinite](https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/415098/Investigators-Pivots-and-Complications?affiliate_id=3289025), also made by me.

Contains all the feats included in that supplement, plus a macro for Devise a Stratagem for convenience.

## How to Install

1. Buy the aforementioned supplement ðŸ˜‰    
*(Don't worry, this is optional, I'm just joshing, but it's appreciated!)*
2. Fire up your Foundry client, and navigate to "Add-on Modules", then click "Install Module"
3. Copy the manifest link (this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cerapter/pf2e-investigators-pnc/master/module.json`) into the "Manifest URL:" part, then install it.   
Effectively, this is what you should get:

4. Enjoy!
5. If you're using the feats and class features included in the module / supplement, report back on how they felt to use in-game.    
*(Also optional, but also appreciated!)*
